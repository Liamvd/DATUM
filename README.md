# DATUM
Overview

DATUM (Data Annotation, Transformation and Unified Mapping) is a web based tool that transforms (un)structured data into structured data formats while enriching said data with metadata.
The final data can be send to a data repository of the users choosing. In it's current development phase, DATUM focusses to create an ETL pipeline to transform data into FAIR compiant RDF through a CDM, which will then be send to AllegroGraph.

History

This tool is a fork from the FAIR-Trauma-Reporting tool that was made as part of the course Data Science in Practice (2024), Leiden University, the Netherlands.

The Fair Trauma Reporting tool aims to facilitate researchers by automating the creation of metadata and labelling of new sources based on an input of ontologies and labes. The output is generated in csv, xml and rdf files which can be used for further data processing and analysing.

This fork was used by the Refugee Protection Working Group, one of the Wehubit teams organised by EEPA.
It has now been more generalised in purpose for VODAN and the Leiden University DSIP course.
The goal of this fork is to enhance the original tool to improve its current capabilities, create new capabilities, and 
transform the tool to be of general use for different projects.

Main Objective

DATUM will be a web based tool that allows user to upload (un)structured data which will then be transformed to a structured data format of their choosing. 
The user will have the option to enrich their stuctured data with metadata. This process is done automatically through an LLM.
Finally, the structured (metadata enriched) data can be pushed to a data repository.
The goal is to make the tool as general use as possible with a lot of flexibility and scalability.
