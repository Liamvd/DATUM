# Fair-Trauma-Reporting

This tool was made by FieldLab 8 as part of the course Data Science in Practice (2024), Leiden University, the Netherlands.

The Fair Trauma Reporting tool aims to facilitate researchers by automating the creation of metadata of new sources based on an input of ontologies and labes. 
The output is generated in csv, xml and rdf files which can be used for further data processing and analysing.
