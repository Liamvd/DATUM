# DATUM
This tool is a fork from the FAIR-Trauma-Reporting tool that was made as part of the course Data Science in Practice (2024), Leiden University, the Netherlands.

The Fair Trauma Reporting tool aims to facilitate researchers by automating the creation of metadata and labelling of new sources based on an input of ontologies and labes. The output is generated in csv, xml and rdf files which can be used for further data processing and analysing.

This fork is used by the Refugee Protection Working Group, one of the Wehubit teams organised by EEPA.
The goal of this fork is to enhance the original tool to improve its current capabilities, create new capabilities, and 
transform the tool to be of general use for different projects.
